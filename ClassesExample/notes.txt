The example in this folder is taken from "Learn How to Program with C++" by Kate Gregory.  

To compile this example type:
c++ Account.cpp SimpleClasses.cpp Transaction.cpp
g++ Account.cpp SimpleClasses.cpp Transaction.cpp
c++ *.cpp
g++ *.cpp
make
make -f changesonly

If we have a file called "makefile" we can type "make" to compile
If we want to compile using a specific makefile we type: "make -f changesonly"
(changesonly is the name of the seperate changefile)

So to compile this you don't need to include
the header file in the compile statement.
Just use:
c++ Functions.cpp AddExample.cpp
OR
g++ Functions.cpp AddExample.cpp
What header files like Functions.h do is literally
copy and paste their contents when called by an 
#include statement such as
#include "Functions.h"

To compile these files on the commandline you type:

c++ Functions.cpp MathTest.cpp

or alternatively you can type:

g++ Functions.cpp MathTest.cpp

By using c++ instead of gcc in the commandline it
correctly "links" the files which means the MathTest.cpp
file can correctly call functions that are in the Functions.cpp file.
